# Explainable Academic Risk Prediction System

This project implements an explainable deep learning based early warning system
for detecting at-risk students using the OULAD dataset.

## Features
- BiLSTM + Attention architecture
- SHAP explainability
- Early risk detection
- ROC-AUC optimized thresholding

## How to Run
1. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Open the main notebook:
   notebooks/Final_Model.ipynb
3. Run all cells

## Dataset
OULAD dataset (Open University Learning Analytics Dataset)
